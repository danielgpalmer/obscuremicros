What is this?

This is the skeleton project + lwip (with an TCP echo server).

How do I use it?

Uart 1 should be connected to your computer via a serial port or USB->UART device like the FT232 or CP210x.
On linux you can then setup SLIP networking like this:

slattach -L -p slip -s 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
ifconfig sl0 192.168.93.1 pointopoint 192.168.93.2 up

This will create a SLIP interface with your chosen serial port (replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with the serial port you
want to use) and then setup point to point IP networking on top of that. The options given to slattach are 
important. -L tells slattach not to care about carrier detect etc, -p slip tells it to use plain old SLIP
and not the default CSLIP that lwip doesn't understand and finally -s 115200 is the baud rate.

What can I do with it?

There is a TCP echo service running on port 7. If you connect with $telnet 192.168.93.2 7; it will echo every
line you send it. You can also ping it.
